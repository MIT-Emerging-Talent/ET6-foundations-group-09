# Constraints

In any collaborative project, understanding and addressing constraints is essential for success.
This group faces a mix of internal involuntary, internal voluntary, and external constraints
that impact their ability to work effectively.

## External

<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over:
  - project deadlines
  - number of unit tests required to pass a code review
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
  - power or connectivity
  - ...
-->

External constraints pose significant hurdles for the group, many of which are tied to
technology and infrastructure. The most prominent issue, identified by 75% of group members,
is technology limitations, such as difficulties with Git, GitHub, and communication tools.
This suggests that technical barriers are impeding the group’s workflow.
Moreover, time zone differences and internet connectivity each affect 50%
of the group, making it challenging to collaborate in real time. Other constraints,
like project deadlines, inconsistent power supply, and limited access to personal computers,
are less widespread but still impact 25% of members. These challenges reflect a diverse
set of external pressures that complicate the group’s ability to work efficiently.

## Internal: Involuntary

<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->

The group is grappling with individual limitations that are beyond their immediate control.
Skill levels stand out as the most significant internal involuntary constraint, with 62.5% of
members identifying it as a challenge. This suggests that some members may feel under qualified
or lack confidence in certain areas, which can hinder progress.
Time is another critical factor—37.5% of members struggle with the amount of time available to
dedicate to the project, while others face conflicting work schedules that make coordination difficult.
Additionally, the inability to respond quickly to messages further exacerbates communication delays.
However, only 12.5% of the group cited their preferred number of working hours as a constraint,
indicating that most members are willing to invest the necessary effort if other challenges are addressed.

## Internal: Voluntary

<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - coding style & conventions
  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
-->
- **Primary Constraint**: 
  - Technology limitations (e.g., Git, GitHub, and communication tools) were the most frequently cited external constraint, affecting 75% of respondents.
- **Time Zone Differences and Connectivity**:
  - Time zone differences and internet connectivity are notable external constraints, each affecting 50% of respondents.
- **Other Concerns**:
  - Project deadlines, inconsistent power supply, and access to a personal computer were mentioned by 25% of respondents each.
